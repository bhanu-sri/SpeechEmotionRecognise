# SpeechEmotionRecognise
## Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for speech emotion recognition. The goal is to accurately classify the emotions expressed in speech signals, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains a collection of labeled audio samples.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and consists of a collection of speech samples labeled with corresponding emotions.
Ravdess = "/kaggle/input/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio/audio_speech_actors_01-24/"
Crema = "/kaggle/input/cremad/AudioWAV/"
Tess = "/kaggle/input/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess/tess toronto emotional speech set data/TESS Toronto emotional speech set data/"
Savee = "/kaggle/input/surrey-audiovisual-expressed-emotion-savee/ALL/"

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA phase, the following insights were discovered:
- Distribution of emotions in the dataset
- Correlations between different audio features and emotions
- Visualization of emotion patterns using spectrograms

  Model Building and evaluation need to be added!
